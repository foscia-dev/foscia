# Getting started

:::tip What you'll learn

-   Creating your first model and using it through model instances
-   Creating your action factory using blueprints
-   Running basic actions on your models with your action factory

:::

:::info

Only here for a simple HTTP client? Check out
[**the simple HTTP client guide**](/docs/guides/actions/http-client).

:::

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you must have installed Foscia packages you will need.
[`@foscia/cli`](/docs/guides/cli) is the recommended way to install and get
started using Foscia.

<ShellCommand
    command={[
        '# Install Foscia CLI',
        'add dev @foscia/cli',
        '# Initialize Foscia and action factory inside "src/data" directory.',
        'foscia init src/data',
    ]}
/>

:::info

Since Foscia is not installed globally, you will need to prefix `foscia` with
your package runner.

:::

### Supported data sources

For the moment, there is no other official implementation available besides
JSON:API and REST. If you would like to interact with another data source, you
should therefore either:

-   **Implement your own action's dependencies**, you should inspire from
    existing implementations to build your own.
-   [**Open an issue or a pull request**](https://github.com/foscia-dev/foscia/issues)
    to suggest a new implementation.

## Your first model

Models represent the structure of your data and are used to simplify and get
type safe interactions with your data source.

### Defining a model

<ShellCommand command="foscia make:model post" />

To declare a model, you just need to use the `makeModel` function. This function
takes up to 2 arguments and returns an ES6 class:

-   The model `type`, which is used by other services to identify your model or
    interact with a data source.
-   The model `definition`, which contains your attributes/relations definitions
    and custom properties and methods.

```ts title="models/post.ts"
// file: models/comment.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from '@foscia/core';
export default class Comment extends makeModel('comments') {}

// file: models/post.ts
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDate } from '@foscia/core';
import Comment from './comment';

export default class Post extends makeModel('posts', {
    title: attr<string>(),
    description: attr<string>(),
    publishedAt: attr(toDate()).nullable(),
    comments: hasMany(() => Comment),
    get published() {
        return !!this.publishedAt;
    },
}) {}
```

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used like any ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```javascript
import Post from './models/post';

const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
post.publishedAt = new Date();
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.published); // true
console.log(post.$exists); // false
```

## Your first actions

### Action factory

#### Creating the action factory

:::info

If you used `@foscia/cli`, your action factory should already be set up.

:::

Once your models are set up, you will probably want to interact with a data
source, such as an API. For this, you will need an action factory which
initialize a preconfigured context for all your future actions. Running actions
using this action factory will be seen in the
[next part of this guide](#running-simple-actions).

Action factory will set up all the required context for interacting with data
source (adapter, (de)serializer, etc.).

To quickly get started, multiple Foscia packages provide blueprint factories
which provide a quick initialization of this action factory with sensible
defaults.

Depending on the usage you are targetting, here is what your action factory may
looks like:

<Tabs groupId="usage">
  <TabItem
    value="jsonapi"
    label="JSON:API"
    default
  >

```javascript
import { makeJsonApi } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

const { action } = makeJsonApi({
    models: [],
    http: {
        baseURL: '/api/v1',
    },
});

export default action;
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem
    value="jsonrest"
    label="JSON REST"
  >

```javascript
import { makeJsonRest } from '@foscia/rest';

const { action } = makeJsonRest({
    models: [],
    http: {
        baseURL: '/api/v1',
    },
});

export default action;
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Notice on blueprints

Using blueprints is a simple and quick way to set up an action factory. However,
it may have some downsides:

-   Only some implementations are available for now, so you may not find
    something which fits your needs
-   Some dependencies (e.g. serializer in a readonly context) may be imported
    even if you don't use them, and it may increase your production bundle size
-   Some behaviors may not be configurable

You may configure the behavior or implementation in two ways:

-   [**Configure your action factory**](/docs/guides/actions/action-factory-configuration)
-   [**Implement custom action factory**](/docs/guides/actions/custom-action-factory)

#### Registering your models

:::info

If you have opt-in for an automatic registration of models during `@foscia/cli`
initialization, you can skip this step!

:::

When using Foscia, actions are not aware of models they should use. This means
Foscia actions cannot resolve a model (e.g. when deserializing) without having
an explicit mapping between a given type and a model.

To register models, you can pass an array of models you wish to use to your
action factory blueprint:

```js
import { makeJsonApi } from '@foscia/jsonapi';
import Post from './models/post';
import Comment from './models/comment';

const { action } = makeJsonApi({
    // Register the models.
    models: [Post, Comment],
});

export default action;
```

:::info

If you don't register your models, Foscia will try to resolve models using
context or relations information (name, model resolver, type, etc.).

:::

#### Builder pattern syntax

If you want to use the builder pattern syntax (e.g. `action().forModel(Post)`
instead of `action().use(forModel(Post))`), you must provide the extensions you
want to use during your action factory creation.

<Tabs groupId="usage">
  <TabItem
    value="jsonapi"
    label="JSON:API"
    default
  >

```js
import { makeJsonApi, jsonApiStarterExtensions } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

const { action } = makeJsonApi({
    // Register the extensions.
    extensions: jsonApiStarterExtensions,
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem
    value="jsonrest"
    label="JSON REST"
  >

```js
import { makeJsonRest, jsonRestStarterExtensions } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

const { action } = makeJsonRest({
    // Register the extensions.
    extensions: jsonRestStarterExtensions,
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can [learn more about extensions](/docs/core-concepts/actions#extensions),
check the [available extensions packs](/docs/reference/actions-extensions). You
can also manually import enhancers and runners extensions you need:

```javascript
import { forModel, include, all, hooksExtensions } from '@foscia/core';
import { makeJsonApi } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

const { action } = makeJsonApi({
    extensions: {
        ...hooksExtensions,
        ...forModel.extension,
        ...include.extension,
        ...all.extension,
    },
});
```

### Running simple actions

To run an action, you can initialize a new action instance by calling your
factory. With this instance, you can call **context enhancers** through `use` to
modify the action context. When you are ready, you can `run` the action with a
given **context runner**.

```javascript
import { all, forModel } from '@foscia/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const posts = await action().use(forModel(Post)).run(all());
```

In Foscia, the context enhancers are doing the majority of work to customize the
action you will run. Context runners only exists to tell how you wish to run the
action and retrieve the result (raw result, model instance, etc.).

A great example of this is when finding a model using its ID. You'll not use a
`find` context runner. Instead, you will need to use a `find` context enhancer
and a `oneOrFail` context runner. This way, you are able to do a find query and
retrieve a raw result when needed.

```javascript
import { find, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = await action().use(find(Post, 'abc-123')).run(oneOrFail());
```

This works the same to send write operations through actions. In the following
example, we are retrieving a raw adapter response instead of model instances.

```javascript
import { create, fill, oneOrCurrent } from '@foscia/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = fill(new Post(), {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    description: 'Your first post',
});

const response = await action().use(create(post)).run(oneOrCurrent());
```

## Advanced actions

### HTTP custom actions

Using JSON:API or REST blueprints, you can also use Foscia to make non-standard
API calls.

This way, you can standardize all API calls across your application, even when
those are non JSON:API/REST related.

```javascript
import { forInstance, raw } from '@foscia/core';
import { makePost } from '@foscia/http';
import Comment from './comment';
import action from './action';

const comment = await action().use(find(Comment, 'abc-123')).run(oneOrFail());

// Make a POST call to "https://example.com/api/v1/services/comments/1/publish"
const response = await action()
    .use(
        forInstance(comment),
        makePost('publish', {
            data: { publishedAt: new Date() },
        }),
    )
    .run(raw());

// This is a raw `fetch` Response object.
console.log(response.status);
```
