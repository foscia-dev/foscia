# Getting started

:::tip What you'll learn

- Creating your first model and using it through model instances
- Creating your action factory using blueprints
- Running basic actions on your models with your action factory

:::

:::info

Only here for a simple HTTP client? Check out
[**the simple HTTP client guide**](/docs/digging-deeper/http).

:::

## Before getting started

Before getting started, you must have installed Foscia packages you will need.
[`@foscia/cli`](/docs/digging-deeper/cli) is the recommended way to install and
get started using Foscia.

<ShellCommand
  command={[
    'add dev @foscia/cli',
    'foscia init',
  ]}
  join
/>

:::info

Since Foscia is not installed globally, you will need to prefix `foscia` with
your package runner.

:::

### Project structure

Foscia files are organized in an opinionated manner. This allow Foscia
to provide better features when using the CLI.

You can learn more about how Foscia files are organized in your project
within the [project structure guide](/docs/core-concepts/project).

### Supported data sources

For the moment, there is no other official implementation available besides
JSON:API and REST. If you would like to interact with another data source, you
should therefore either:

- **Implement your own action's dependencies**, you should inspire from existing
  implementations to build your own.
- [**Open an issue or a pull request**](https://github.com/foscia-dev/foscia/issues)
  to suggest a new implementation.

### Supported frameworks

Foscia can integrate in pretty any TypeScript/JavaScript projects.
That being said, supporting some frameworks features may require additional
configuration (such as SSR inside Nuxt).
You can find more information about frameworks integrations inside
[the integrations guides](/docs/category/integrations).

If you need specific features to integrate with an unsupported framework,
feel free to [open an issue or a pull request](https://github.com/foscia-dev/foscia/issues).

## First model

Models represent the structure of your data and are used to simplify and get
type safe interactions with your data source.

### Defining a model

<ShellCommand command="foscia make model post" />

To declare a model, you just need to use the `makeModel` function. This function
takes up to 2 arguments and returns an ES6 class:

- The model `type`, which is used by other services to identify your model or
  interact with a data source.
- The model `definition`, which contains your attributes/relations definitions
  and custom properties and methods.

```typescript title="models/post.ts"
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDateTime } from '@foscia/core';
import Comment from './comment';

export default class Post extends makeModel('posts', {
  title: attr<string>(),
  description: attr<string>(),
  publishedAt: attr(toDateTime()).nullable(),
  comments: hasMany(() => Comment),
  get published() {
    return !!this.publishedAt;
  },
}) {}
```

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used like any ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```typescript
import Post from './models/post';

const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
post.publishedAt = new Date();
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.published); // true
console.log(post.$exists); // false
```

## First actions

### Action factory

#### Creating the action factory

:::info

If you used `@foscia/cli`, your action factory should already be set up.

:::

Once your models are set up, you will probably want to interact with a data
source, such as an API. For this, you will need an action factory which
initialize a preconfigured context for all your future actions. Running actions
using this action factory will be seen in the
[next part of this guide](#running-simple-actions).

Action factory will set up all the required context for interacting with data
source (adapter, (de)serializer, etc.).

To quickly get started, multiple Foscia packages provide blueprint factories
which provide a quick initialization of this action factory with sensible
defaults.

Depending on the usage you are targetting, here is what your action factory may
looks like:

<Tabs groupId="usage">
<TabItem
  value="jsonapi"
  label="JSON:API"
  default
>

```typescript
import { makeActionFactory, makeCache } from '@foscia/core';
import {
  makeJsonApiAdapter,
  makeJsonApiDeserializer,
  makeJsonApiSerializer,
} from '@foscia/jsonapi';

export default makeActionFactory({
  ...makeCache(),
  ...makeJsonApiDeserializer(),
  ...makeJsonApiSerializer(),
  ...makeJsonApiAdapter({
    baseURL: '/api/v1',
  }),
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
  value="jsonrest"
  label="JSON REST"
>

```typescript
import { makeActionFactory, makeCache } from '@foscia/core';
import {
  makeJsonRestAdapter,
  makeJsonRestDeserializer,
  makeJsonRestSerializer,
} from '@foscia/rest';

export default makeActionFactory({
  ...makeCache(),
  ...makeJsonRestDeserializer(),
  ...makeJsonRestSerializer(),
  ...makeJsonRestAdapter({
    baseURL: '/api',
  }),
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Builder pattern syntax

If you want to use the builder pattern syntax (e.g. `action().query(Post).all()`
instead of `action().run(query(Post), all())`), you must provide the extensions
you want to use during your action factory creation.

Extensions are the second argument passed to `makeActionFactory`.

<Tabs groupId="usage">
  <TabItem
    value="jsonapi"
    label="JSON:API"
    default
  >

```typescript
import { makeActionFactory } from '@foscia/core';
import { jsonApiStarterExtensions } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

export default makeActionFactory(
  {
    // makeJsonApiAdapter(), ...etc.
  },
  jsonApiStarterExtensions,
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem
    value="jsonrest"
    label="JSON REST"
  >

```typescript
import { makeActionFactory } from '@foscia/core';
import { jsonRestStarterExtensions } from '@foscia/rest';

export default makeActionFactory(
  {
    // makeJsonRestAdapter(), ...etc.
  },
  jsonRestStarterExtensions,
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

Be aware that using extensions and builder pattern syntax might increase
your bundle size, because functions are imported even if you are not
using it.

:::

### Running simple actions

To run an action, you can initialize a new action instance by calling your
factory. With this instance, you can provide **context enhancers** to
modify the action context, and a **context runner** to run the action.

Simplest way of running an action is to call `run`, providing enhancers
as argument and providing a runner as last argument. This is called
the variadic `run` calls. Documentation is generally using this call format.

You can also decompose those calls through `use` and `run` individual calls,
which will better show how Foscia actions works.

```typescript
import { all, query } from '@foscia/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

// Variadic run.
const posts = await action().run(
  query(Post),
  all(),
);
// Equivalent: individual calls.
const posts = await action()
  .use(query(Post))
  .run(all());
```

In Foscia, the context enhancers are doing the majority of work to customize the
action you will run. Context runners only exists to tell how you wish to run the
action and retrieve the result (raw result, model instance, etc.).

A great example of this is when finding a model using its ID. You'll not use a
"find" context runner. Instead, you will need to use a `query` context enhancer
and a `oneOrFail` context runner. This way, you are able to do a find query and
retrieve a raw result when needed.

```typescript
import { query, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = await action().run(
  query(Post, 'abc-123'),
  oneOrFail(),
);
```

This works the same to send write operations through actions. In the following
example, we are retrieving a raw adapter response instead of model instances.

```typescript
import { create, fill, oneOrCurrent } from '@foscia/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = fill(new Post(), {
  title: 'Hello World!',
  description: 'Your first post',
});

const createdPost = await action().run(
  create(post),
  oneOrCurrent(),
);
```

### Advanced actions

#### HTTP custom actions

Using JSON:API or REST blueprints, you can also use Foscia to make non-standard
(non-CRUD) API calls.

This way, you can standardize all API calls across your application, even when
those are non JSON:API/REST related.

```typescript
import { query, raw, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';
import { makePost } from '@foscia/http';
import Comment from './comment';
import action from './action';

const comment = await action().run(
  query(Comment, '1'),
  oneOrFail(),
);

// Make a POST call to "https://example.com/api/v1/comments/1/publish"
const response = await action().run(
  query(comment),
  makePost('publish', {
    data: { publishedAt: new Date() },
  }),
  raw(),
);

// This is a raw `fetch` Response object.
console.log(response.status);
```
