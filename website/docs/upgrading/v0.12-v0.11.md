## Upgrading to v0.12 from v0.11

### Models setups are replaced with hooks

**Likelihood Of Impact: Medium**

Models, composables and models factories setup functions (`boot` and `init`)
are replaced by already implemented hook system. If you are using them,
you can remove the setup object and pass your callbacks to new `onBoot`
and `onInit` functions. This provides a full-featured and unified way to hook
on models events.

As a consequence, `setup` static method on model classes and typings
for models setup have been removed.

```typescript
import { makeComposable, onBoot } from '@foscia/core';

const publishable = makeComposable({
  /* ...definition */
// highlight.deletion
}, {
// highlight.deletion
  boot: (model) => {
// highlight.deletion
  }
});

// highlight.addition
onBoot(publishable, (model) => {
// highlight.addition
});

export default publishable;
```
