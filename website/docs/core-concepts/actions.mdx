# Actions

:::tip What you'll learn

- Enhancing actions
- Running actions
- Extending actions for builder pattern calls
- Conditionally enhancing and running actions
- Registering hooks on actions

:::

## Before reading this guide

This guide is only about basic usage and lifecycle of actions.

- You can read more about action factories setups in the
  [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#action-factory).
- Advanced usage is different between the various implementations. You can see
  advanced usage of actions for your implementation inside the
  [digging deeper actions guide](/docs/category/actions).
- If you want to see some concrete examples on how actions could be used, you
  can check the [examples documentation section](/docs/category/examples).

## Usage

Once your models and action factory are set up, you are ready to run actions
through your models.

Foscia uses two typologies of functions to run actions, **enhancers** and
**runners**, which are described in the [lifecycle guide](#lifecycle).

:::info

Examples of the documentation commonly use
[**variadic `run` calls**](#variadic-run) on actions, as this is the simplest
way of using actions.

:::

### Retrieving records

`query` can target a records index using a model. You can use it in
combination with `all` to retrieve a list of the model instances.

```typescript
import { query, all } from '@foscia/core';

const posts = await action().run(
  query(Post),
  all(),
);

posts.forEach((post) => {
  console.log(post.title);
});
```

In addition, `query` also provide a way to target a record using a model and
an ID. You can use it in combination with `oneOrFail` or `oneOr` to retrieve
a single record and handle not found errors.

```typescript
import { query, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const postOrFail = await action().run(
  query(Post, '1'),
  oneOrFail(),
);

const postOrNull = await action().run(
  query(Post, '2'),
  oneOr(() => null),
);
```

Finally, `query` can also be used to target a record using an instance.
If the instance does not exist, this will target the records index, otherwise
it will target the record. This can be used when writing a record (e.g.
create/update) or when [lazy loading a relation](#lazy-loading-relations).

```typescript
import { query, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const post = await action().run(query(somePost), oneOrFail());
```

### Creating and updating records

You can create or update records using `create` and `update` functions. As a
convenience, Foscia provides a `save` function which will call `create` or
`update` depending on the existence state of your record.

`oneOrCurrent` is a runner which you can combine with those enhancers to always
retrieve an instance, even if your data source does not return the record on
those actions (such as a `204 No Content` on update). It will return a record if
there is one if your data source response, otherwise it will return the
initially provided instance.

You can also combine those functions with `none` runner to not handle the data
source response.

```typescript
import { create, save, fill, oneOrCurrent, none } from '@foscia/core';

const post = await action().run(
  create(fill(new Post(), { title: 'Hello World!' })),
  include('author'),
  oneOrCurrent(),
);

post.title = 'Edited Hello World!';

await action().run(save(post), none());
```

### Deleting records

You can use `destroy` to trigger a record deletion. You can combine it with
`none` to ignore the data source's response (errors are still thrown by the
adapter).

```typescript
import { destroy, none } from '@foscia/core';

await action().run(destroy(post), none());
```

### Relationships

#### Eager loading relations

Some [implementations of Foscia](/docs/category/implementations)
support dedicated relationships operations (such as JSON:API).
With those, you may read and write relationships.

#### Eager loading relations

Eager loading provides a way to retrieve records and eager
load related models without further requests. It also alleviates the
"N + 1" query problem.

To eager load a relation, you can use the `include` function.

```typescript
import { query, all, include } from '@foscia/core';

const posts = await action().run(
  query(Post),
  include('author'),
  all(),
);
```

#### Lazy loading relations

Lazy loading provides a way to fetch related records for a
relation with an already retrieved a record.

```typescript
import { query, all, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

// Fetch a post without relations.
const post = await action().run(query(Post, 1), oneOrFail());
// Fetch "comments" relation.
const comments = await action().run(query(post, 'comments'), all());
```

:::info

Lazy loading a record's relation won't affect the given record instance
(it won't hydrate the relation on parent instance, here `post`).

:::

#### Writing relations

##### To one

For `hasOne` relationship, you can use `associate` and `dissociate`
to change the relation value.

```typescript
import { associate, dissociate, none } from '@foscia/core';

// Associate myUser as myPost's author.
await action().run(
  associate(myPost, 'author', myUser),
  none(),
);
console.log(myPost.author); // myUser

// Dissociate author of myPost.
await action().run(
  dissociate(myPost, 'author'),
  none(),
);
console.log(myPost.author); // null
```

:::info

Using `associate` and `dissociate` **will update** the model's property and mark
it synced.

:::

##### To many

For `hasMany` relationship, you can use `attach`, `detach` and `updateRelation`
to change the relation value:

- `attach` will attach one or many related records, without touching existing
  related records;
- `detach` will detach one or many related records, without touching attaching
  other records;
- `updateRelation` will sync related records to the given records (detach past
  records, attach given records);

```typescript
import { attach, detach, updateRelation, none } from '@foscia/core';

// Attach myUser1 and myUser2 to myTeam's members.
await action().run(
  attach(myTeam, 'members', [myUser1, myUser2]),
  none(),
);

// Detach myUser1 and myUser2 from myTeam's members.
await action().run(
  detach(myTeam, 'members', [myUser1, myUser2]),
  none(),
);

// Sync myUser1 and myUser2 as myTeam's members.
await action().run(
  updateRelation(myTeam, 'members', [myUser1, myUser2]),
  none(),
);
```

:::warning

Using `attach`, `detach` and `updateRelation` **will not update** the model's
property.

:::

##### Creating through

<FunctionInfo version="0.9.3" />

In some data source implementation, you may want to create a record "through"
a parent record's relation. As an example, creating a comment through a post
in a REST API, and using a `POST /posts/1/comments` request.

This can be achieved using the `create` enhancer.

```typescript
import { create } from '@foscia/core';

// Create a comment through a post.
await action().run(
  create(newComment, post, 'comments'),
  oneOrCurrent(),
);
```

### Caching

When having a cache enabled on your action, all fetched records are cached
when deserializing. You can use the cache to retrieve
an already fetched record without interacting with your data source again
using `cached` and `cachedOrFail`.

```typescript
import { query, cached, cachedOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const postOrNull = await action().run(query(Post, 1), cached());
const postOrFail = await action().run(query(Post, 1), cachedOrFail());
```

Sometimes, you may want to interact with the cache if your record does not
have been cached already. For this particular case, you can use `cachedOr`.

```typescript
import { query, cachedOr, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const cachedPostOrFetch = await action().run(query(Post, 1), cachedOr(oneOrFail()));
```

:::info

`cached` runners will check for loaded relations if you are requesting
relations `include`. If some relations (even deep ones) are not loaded,
it will act as the record is not inside the cache.

:::

### Conditionals

Sometimes, you may need to conditionally apply an enhancer or run an action. As
an example, you may want to sort results differently based on the user's defined
sort's direction. This can be done easily using the `when` helper:

```typescript
import { query, when } from '@foscia/core';
import { sortByDesc } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

action().run(
  query(Post),
  when(displayLatestFirst, sortByDesc('createdAt'),
);
```

`when` returns a new enhancer or runner based on the given value's _truthiness_.
It will execute the first enhancer/runner only if its value is _truthy_. You may
pass the value as a factory function returning the value, and even a promise
value. You may also pass a second enhancer/runner which will only execute if the
value is _falsy_. Each callback arguments will receive the action as their first
argument and the value as their second argument. Each callback may also be
async, as any enhancers and runners.

Here are further examples:

```typescript
import { changed, create, oneOrFail, when } from '@foscia/core';

const post = fill(new Post(), userInputData);

action().run(
  create(post),
  when(
    () => /* compute a special value */,
    (a, specialTruthyValue) => /* do something */,
    (a, specialFalsyValue) => /* do something */,
  ),
  when(
    changed(post),
    oneOrFail(),
    () => post,
  ),
);
```

## Lifecycle

When using [variadic `run` calls](#variadic-run), Foscia actions lifecycle
is "hidden" by variadic arguments. In fact, all actions execution have
3 steps: instantiation, enhancements and execution (run).

```typescript
action().run(               // Instantiation.
  query(Post),              // `query` enhancement.
  include('comments'),      // `include` enhancement.
  all(),                    // `all` run.
);
```

The above example is equivalent to and can be decomposed as follows:

```typescript
action()                    // Instantiation.
  .use(query(Post))         // `query` enhancement.
  .use(include('comments')) // `include` enhancement.
  .run(all());              // `all` run.
```

### Instantiation

As stated in the
[getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#running-simple-actions), actions
are instantiated through your action factory. In this guide, we'll admit you
have a setup action factory.

### Enhancers

An action instance can receive multiple enhancements that will build an
appropriate context to run requests to your data sources.

Each enhancer can be applied using the `use` action method. Note that those
enhancers are not instantly applied to the action context, but during the action
run step (or context computation).

```typescript
action()
  // Enhance the action.
  .use(query(Post))
  .use(include('comments'));
```

#### Variadic `use`

`use` also support variadic enhancers. Number of arguments might be limited,
check the function signature for details.

```typescript
action().use(
  query(Post),
  include('comments'),
  sortByDesc('publishedAt'),
  // etc.
);
```

#### Enhancers API guide

<Link className="button border--gradient" to="/docs/reference/actions-enhancers">
  Available enhancers API guide
</Link>

### Runners

An action instance can be run using the `run` method. The runner can execute
multiple enhancers or runners internally.

When an action run, it does 3 things:

- Dequeue all enhancers since the action instantiation and builds context
- Execute the runner and each of its internal enhancers/runners (this may update
  the context)
- Return the runner result (might be any value, including void or an error
  throwing)

Internally, action running will also trigger [actions hooks](#hooks).

```typescript
action()
  .use(query(Post))
  .use(include('comments'))
  // Run the action.
  .run(all());
```

#### Variadic `run`

`run` also support variadic enhancers. Last argument must be a runner.
Number of arguments might be limited, check the function signature for details.

```typescript
const posts = await action().run(
  query(Post),
  include('comments'),
  sortByDesc('publishedAt'),
  all(),
);
```

#### Runners API guide

<Link className="button border--gradient" to="/docs/reference/actions-runners">
  Available runners API guide
</Link>

### Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on action instance using the hook
registration function:

- `onRunning`: after context computation, before context runner execution.
- `onSuccess`: after context runner successful execution (no error thrown).
- `onError`: after context runner failed execution (error thrown).
- `onFinally`: after context runner successful or failed execution.

To register a hook callback, you must use the registration enhancer on your
building action.

```typescript
import {
    onRunning,
    onSuccess,
    onError,
    onFinally,
} from '@foscia/core';

action().use(onRunning(({ context }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onSuccess(({ context, result }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onError(({ context, error }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onFinally(({ context }) => /* ... */));
```

:::info

Hooks' callbacks are async and executed in a sequential fashion (one by one, not
parallelized).

:::

You can temporally disable hook execution for a given action by using the
`withoutHooks` function. `withoutHooks` can receive a sync or async
callback: if an async callback is passed, it will return a `Promise`.

```typescript
import { query, all, withoutHooks } from '@foscia/core';

// Retrieve a list of User instances without action hooks running.
const users = await withoutHooks(action(), async (a) => {
  return await a.use(query(User)).run(all());
});
```

:::warning

**Foscia may also register hooks internally** when using some enhancers. Those
provide some library features
([**models hooks**](/docs/core-concepts/models#hooks), etc.). Be careful running
actions without hooks, as those hooks will also be disable.

:::

## Extensions

Sometimes, functional programming can be frustrating, because you must always
rewrite the same words (e.g. `use`) to keep a builder pattern styled code.

Extensions provide a set of properties or methods which will be added to your
actions' instances. As an action, extensions can avoid you writing `use` or
`run` by adding enhancers/runners methods on you action.

The first step to use one or many extensions is to update your action factory in
which you should provide a second parameter.

```typescript title="action.ts"
import {
  makeActionFactory,
  query,
  include,
  all,
  hooksExtensions,
} from '@foscia/core';

export default makeActionFactory(
  {
    // makeJsonRestAdapter(), ...etc.
  },
  {
    ...hooksExtensions(),
    ...query.extension(),
    ...include.extension(),
    ...all.extension(),
  },
);
```

You can now use the extended enhancers and runners without calling `use` or
`run`:

```typescript
import action from './action';

await action().query(Post).include('tags').all();
```

Every enhancers and runners of Foscia provide a `.extension()` property which is
extendable by an action instance.

You may extend your action with any enhancers or runners extensions manually.
Otherwise, you may also use **prebuild extensions packs**. Those provide
multiple extensions in one exported object allowing you to extend multiple
extensions at one time!

</Link>

:::warning

Keep in mind that using extensions will avoid tree-shaking the extended
enhancers or runners functions (even when those are unused in your codebase),
because those are imported by their extensions.
