- Running actions
- Conditionally enhancing and running actions
- Action lifecycle
- Action call styles

:::

## Before reading this guide

This guide is only about basic usage and lifecycle of actions.
To learn more, you can:

- [Check the getting started guide to learn more about action factory setup](/docs/getting-started#first-actions)
- [Read the usages guides to learn more about possibilities with your implementation](/docs/category/usages)
- [Learn advanced capabilities of actions in the dedicated digging deeper guides](/docs/category/actions)
- [Discover actions through examples](/docs/category/examples)

## Usage

Once your models and action factory are set up, you are ready to run actions
through your models.

Foscia uses two typologies of functions to run actions, **enhancers** and
**runners**, which are described in the [lifecycle guide](#lifecycle).
The next part of this guide focuses on most common actions (e.g. CRUD).

:::tip

To complete this, you can browse the API documentation to see available
[**enhancers**](/docs/api/@foscia/core/#enhancers) and
[**runners**](/docs/api/@foscia/core/#runners).

:::

### Retrieving records

[`query`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/query) can target a records index
using a model. You can use it in combination with
[`all`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/all) to retrieve a list of
the model instances.

```typescript
import { query, all } from '@foscia/core';

const posts = await action(
  query(Post),
  all(),
);

posts.forEach((post) => {
  console.log(post.title);
});
```

In addition, [`query`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/query) also provide a
way to target a record using a model and an ID. You can use it in combination
with [`oneOrFail`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/oneOrFail) or
[`one`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/one) to retrieve a single record
and handle not found errors.

```typescript
import { query, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const post = await action(
  query(Post, '1'),
  oneOrFail(),
);

const postOrNull = await action(
  query(Post, '2'),
  one(),
);
```

:::info

[`oneOrFail`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/oneOrFail) will throw a
[`RecordNotFoundError`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/classes/RecordNotFoundError)
when encountering a not found response from adapter (e.g. HTTP 404)
or an empty list of deserialized instances (e.g. HTTP 204).
[`oneOr`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/oneOr) will use your provided
callback and [`one`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/one) will return `null`.

:::

Finally, [`query`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/query) can also be used to
target a record using an instance. If the instance does not exist, this will
target the records index, otherwise it will target the record.
This can be used when writing a record (e.g. create/update)
or when [lazy loading a relation](#lazy-loading-relations).

```typescript
import { query, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const post = await action(query(somePost), oneOrFail());
```

### Creating and updating records

You can create or update records using
[`create`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/create) and
[`update`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/update) functions. As a convenience,
Foscia provides a [`save`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/save) function which
will call [`create`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/create) or
[`update`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/update) depending on the existence
state of your record.

[`current`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/current) is a runner
which you can combine with those enhancers to always retrieve an instance,
even if your data source does not return the record on
those actions (such as a `204 No Content` on update). It will return a record if
there is one if your data source response, otherwise it will return the
initially provided instance.

You can also combine those functions with
[`none`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/none) runner to not handle the data
source response.

```typescript
import { create, save, fill, current, none } from '@foscia/core';

const post = await action(
  create(fill(new Post(), { title: 'Hello World!' })),
  include('author'),
  current(),
);

post.title = 'Edited Hello World!';

await action(save(post), none());
```

### Deleting records

#### Deleting by instance

You can use [`destroy`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/destroy) to trigger
a record deletion. You can combine it with
[`none`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/none) to ignore the data
source's response (errors are still thrown by the adapter).

```typescript
import { destroy, none } from '@foscia/core';

await action(destroy(post), none());
```

#### Deleting by ID

<FunctionInfo version="0.13.0" />

In addition, you can delete a record using only its model and ID, instead of
passing an already retrieved instance.

```typescript
import { destroy, none } from '@foscia/core';

await action(destroy(Post, '1'), none());
```

### Relationships

#### Eager loading relations

Some [implementations of Foscia](/docs/category/implementations)
support dedicated relationships operations (such as JSON:API).
With those, you may read and write relationships.

#### Eager loading relations

Eager loading provides a way to retrieve records and eager
load related models without further requests. It also alleviates the
"N + 1" query problem.

To eager load a relation, you can use the
[`include`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/include) function.

```typescript
import { query, all, include } from '@foscia/core';

const posts = await action(
  query(Post),
  include('author'),
  all(),
);
```

#### Lazy loading relations

Lazy loading provides a way to fetch related records for a
relation with an already retrieved a record.

```typescript
import { query, all, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

// Fetch a post without relations.
const post = await action(query(Post, 1), oneOrFail());
// Fetch "comments" relation.
const comments = await action(query(post, 'comments'), all());
```

:::info

Lazy loading a record's relation won't affect the given record instance
(it won't hydrate the relation on parent instance, here `post`).

:::

#### Writing relations

##### To one

For [`hasOne`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/hasOne) relationship,
you can use [`associate`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/associate)
and [`dissociate`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/dissociate)
to change the relation value.

```typescript
import { associate, dissociate, none } from '@foscia/core';

// Associate myUser as myPost's author.
await action(
  associate(myPost, 'author', myUser),
  none(),
);
console.log(myPost.author); // myUser

// Dissociate author of myPost.
await action(
  dissociate(myPost, 'author'),
  none(),
);
console.log(myPost.author); // null
```

:::info

Using [`associate`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/associate) and
[`dissociate`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/dissociate) **will update**
the model's property and mark it synced.

:::

##### To many

For [`hasMany`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/hasMany) relationship, you can
use [`attach`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/attach),
[`detach`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/detach) and
[`updateRelation`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/updateRelation)
to change the relation value:

- [`attach`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/attach) will attach one or
  many related records, without touching existing related records;
- [`detach`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/detach) will detach one or
  many related records, without touching attaching other records;
- [`updateRelation`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/updateRelation) will
  sync related records to the given records (detach past records, attach given records);

```typescript
import { attach, detach, updateRelation, none } from '@foscia/core';

// Attach myUser1 and myUser2 to myTeam's members.
await action(
  attach(myTeam, 'members', [myUser1, myUser2]),
  none(),
);

// Detach myUser1 and myUser2 from myTeam's members.
await action(
  detach(myTeam, 'members', [myUser1, myUser2]),
  none(),
);

// Sync myUser1 and myUser2 as myTeam's members.
await action(
  updateRelation(myTeam, 'members', [myUser1, myUser2]),
  none(),
);
```

:::warning

Using [`attach`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/attach),
[`detach`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/detach) and
[`updateRelation`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/updateRelation)
**will not update** the model's property.

:::

##### Creating through

<FunctionInfo version="0.9.3" />

In some data source implementation, you may want to create a record "through"
a parent record's relation. As an example, creating a comment through a post
in a REST API, and using a `POST /posts/1/comments` request.

This can be achieved using the
[`create`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/create) enhancer.

```typescript
import { create, current } from '@foscia/core';

// Create a comment through a post.
await action(
  create(newComment, post, 'comments'),
  current(),
);
```

### Retrieving from cache

When having a cache enabled on your action, all fetched records are cached
when deserializing. You can use the cache to retrieve
an already fetched record without interacting with your data source again
using [`cached`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cached) and
[`cachedOrFail`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cachedOrFail).

```typescript
import { query, cached, cachedOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const post = await action(query(Post, 1), cachedOrFail());
const postOrNull = await action(query(Post, 1), cached());
```

Sometimes, you may want to interact with the cache if your record does not
have been cached already. For this particular case, you can use
[`cachedOr`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cachedOr).

```typescript
import { query, cachedOr, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';

const cachedPostOrFetch = await action(query(Post, 1), cachedOr(oneOrFail()));
```

:::info

[`cachedOrFail`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cachedOrFail) will throw a
[`RecordNotFoundError`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/classes/RecordNotFoundError)
when encountering a not found response from adapter (e.g. HTTP 404)
or an empty list of deserialized instances (e.g. HTTP 204).
[`cachedOr`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cachedOr) will use your provided
callback and [`cached`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cached) will return
`null`.

In addition, [`cached`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/cached) runners
will check for loaded relations if you are requesting relations using
[`include`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/include).
If some relations (even deep ones) are not loaded, it will act as the record
is not available the cache.

:::

### Conditionals

Sometimes, you may need to conditionally apply an enhancer or run an action. As
an example, you may want to sort results differently based on the user's defined
search or sort's direction. This can be done easily using the
[`when`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/when) helper, which can receive enhancers, runners or callbacks:

```typescript
import { query, when, all } from '@foscia/core';
import { filterBy, sortByDesc } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

action(
  query(Post),
  when(searchQuery, (a, s) => a(
    filterBy('search', s),
    sortByDesc('searchMatch'),
  )),
  when(displayLatestFirst, sortByDesc('createdAt')),
  all(),
);
```

[`when`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/when) returns a new enhancer or
runner based on the given value's _truthiness_.
It will execute the first enhancer/runner only if its value is _truthy_. You may
pass the value as a factory function returning the value, and even a promise
value. You may also pass a second enhancer/runner which will only execute if the
value is _falsy_. Each callback arguments will receive the action as their first
argument and the value as their second argument. Each callback may also be
async, as any enhancers and runners.

:::info

[`when`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/when) will create a new enhancer or
runner which will be **evaluated on run**.
This has benefits, as the condition can be an async value or
callback, but it also means that the condition won't be evaluated immediately
if action is not ran immediately.

:::

Here are further examples:

```typescript
import { changed, create, oneOrFail, when } from '@foscia/core';

const post = fill(new Post(), userInputData);

action(
  create(post),
  when(
    () => /* compute a special value */,
    (a, specialTruthyValue) => /* do something */,
    (a, specialFalsyValue) => /* do something */,
  ),
  when(
    changed(post),
    oneOrFail(),
    () => post,
  ),
);
```

### Errors catching

Catching special errors is a common use case when dealing with data exchanges.
For this, Foscia provides a [`catchIf`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/catchIf)
runner, allowing you to quickly handle common error management scenarios.

You can use [`catchIf`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/catchIf) to make your
runner returns `null` on every error. You can compare this code to his
equivalent without using [`catchIf`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/catchIf),
which is more verbose.

```typescript
const postOrNull = await action(
  query(Post, '123'),
  catchIf(oneOrFail()),
);
```

<details>

<summary>

Equivalent without `catchIf`

</summary>

```typescript
let postOrNull = null as Post | null;

try {
  postOrNull = await action(
    query(Post, '123'),
    oneOrFail(),
  );
} catch (error) {
  postOrNull = null;
}
```

</details>

#### Ignoring specific errors

In the following example, we would like to create a stat event for each page
viewed, ignoring all "too many requests" errors.

```typescript
const statEvent = fill(new StatEvent(), {
  type: 'page-viewed',
  url: 'https://example.com',
});

await action(
  create(statEvent),
  catchIf(none(), (error) => error instanceof HttpTooManyRequestsError),
);
```

<details>

<summary>

Equivalent without `catchIf`

</summary>

```typescript
const statEvent = fill(new StatEvent(), {
  type: 'page-viewed',
  url: 'https://example.com',
});

try {
  await action(
    create(statEvent),
    none(),
  );
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof HttpTooManyRequestsError) {
    // Ignoring too many requests errors.
  } else {
    // Throwing any other errors.
    throw error;
  }
}
```

</details>

#### Using another runner on specific errors

Instead of returning `null` on caught errors, you can also use
[`catchIf`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/catchIf) to execute another
runner when catching errors.

```typescript
// Run a first `oneOrFail`, and another one if an error is thrown.
await action(
  query(Post, '123'),
  catchIf(oneOrFail(), () => oneOrFail())
);

// Run a first `oneOrFail`, and another one only if a "too many requests"
// error is thrown.
await action(
  query(Post, '123'),
  catchIf(oneOrFail(), (error) => (
    error instanceof HttpTooManyRequestsError && oneOrFail()
  ))
);
```

Here is a real world example which uses catch runner to retry a request
which has been rejected by the server after a 15sec delay using a hypothetical
`wait` helper function.

```typescript
await action(
  create(statEvent),
  catchIf(none(), (error) => (
    error instanceof HttpTooManyRequestsError
      && (async (action) => {
        await wait(15 * 1000);

        return action.run(none());
      })
  )),
);
```

## Lifecycle

When using variadic factory calls (see [calls styles](#calls-styles)),
Foscia actions lifecycle is "hidden" by variadic arguments.
In fact, all actions execution have 3 steps:
creation, enhancements and execution (run).

```typescript
// Creation, context enhancements (`query`, `include`) and run (`all`) in one call.
action(
  query(Post),
  include('comments'),
  all(),
);
```

The above example is equivalent to the following:

```typescript
action()                    // Creation.
  .use(query(Post))         // `query` enhancement.
  .use(include('comments')) // `include` enhancement.
  .run(all());              // `all` run.
```

### Creation

As stated in the
[getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#running-simple-actions), actions
are created through your action factory. The creation step can already use
enhancers, generally to provide common dependencies (adapter, serializer, etc.).
In this guide, we'll admit you have a setup action factory.

### Enhancers

An action can receive multiple enhancements that will build an
appropriate context to run requests to your data sources.

Each enhancer can be applied using the `use` action method. Note that those
enhancers are not instantly applied to the action context, but during the action
run step (or context computation).

```typescript
action()
  // Enhance the action.
  .use(query(Post))
  .use(include('comments'));
```

### Runners

An action can be run using the `run` method. The runner can execute
multiple enhancers or runners internally.

When an action run, it does 3 things:

- Dequeue all enhancers since the action instantiation and builds context
- Execute the runner and each of its internal enhancers/runners (this may update
  the context)
- Return the runner result (might be any value, including void or an error
  throwing)

Internally, action running will also trigger
[actions hooks](/docs/digging-deeper/actions/actions-hooks).

```typescript
action()
  .use(query(Post))
  .use(include('comments'))
  // Run the action.
  .run(all());
```

## Calls styles

Foscia provide various action call styles to make your action run expression
shorter and simpler to write.

### Variadic style

This call style was introduced and improved multiple times.

#### Variadic action factory `use` or `run`

Action factory support variadic enhancers (that can finish with a runner)
by passing those variadic arguments directly to the factory,
and will immediately call `use` or `run` on the action.

This is the recommended way of running action.

```typescript
const posts = await action(
  query(Post),
  include('comments'),
  sortByDesc('publishedAt'),
  all(),
);
```

:::warning

`run` variadic call must use an official runner (`all`, `oneOrFail`, etc.)
or a custom runner created with `makeRunner`, otherwise it will handle
the variadic call as a `use` call, because it won't be able to detect a `run`
is requested from an anonymous runner function.

:::

#### Variadic action invocation `use` or `run`

Action object support variadic enhancers (that can finish with a runner)
by invoking the action object with those variadic arguments,
and will immediately call `use` or `run` on the action.

This is the recommended way of enhancing an action inside a callback (such as
inside [`when`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/when)).

```typescript
const posts = await action(
  query(Post),
  when(search, (a, s) => a(
    filterBy('search', s),
    sortBy('search'),
  )),
  all(),
);
```

:::warning

`run` variadic call must use an official runner (`all`, `oneOrFail`, etc.)
or a custom runner created with `makeRunner`, otherwise it will handle
the variadic call as a `use` call, because it won't be able to detect a `run`
is requested from an anonymous runner function.

:::

#### Variadic `use`

`use` also support variadic enhancers. Number of arguments might be limited,
check the function signature for details.

```typescript
action().use(
  query(Post),
  include('comments'),
  sortByDesc('publishedAt'),
  // etc.
);
```

#### Variadic `run`

`run` also support variadic enhancers finishing with a runner, just like the
factory variadic calls. Number of arguments might be limited,
check the function signature for details.

```typescript
const posts = await action().run(
  query(Post),
  include('comments'),
  sortByDesc('publishedAt'),
  all(),
);
```

### Original style

This call style was the only available way of running an action at Foscia's launch.
It has the advantage of being clear about the action lifecycle, but is more
verbose.

```typescript
const posts = await action()
  .use(query(Post))
  .use(include('comments'))
  .run(all());
```
