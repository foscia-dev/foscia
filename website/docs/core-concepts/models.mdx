# Models

:::tip What you'll learn

- Defining basic models with attributes and relations
- Extending your models with custom properties
- Registering hooks on models

:::

## Models

### Using CLI

You can generate a new model using [`@foscia/cli`](/docs/digging-deeper/usages/cli).

<ShellCommand command="foscia make model post" />

### Model factory

To declare a model, you just need to use the
[`makeModel`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeModel) function.
This function takes up to 2 arguments and returns a
[`Model`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/Model) constructor:

- The `type` string or a
[configuration object](/docs/digging-deeper/models/models-configuration).
- The [optional `definition` of the model](#definition): an object
containing property definition factories, custom properties, custom
methods and composables.

```typescript
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDateTime } from '@foscia/core';

export default makeModel('posts', {
  /* The model definition */
  title: attr<string>(),
  description: attr<string>(),
  publishedAt: attr(toDateTime()).nullable(),
  comments: hasMany(() => Comment),
  get published() {
    return !!this.publishedAt;
  },
});
```

### Extending a model class

[`makeModel`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeModel) will return a
[`Model`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/Model) constructor
which can be extended by an ES6 class.

```typescript
export default class Post extends makeModel('posts') {}
```

The returned [`Model`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/Model) constructor
also implements [`ExtendableModel`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/ExtendableModel)
and provides static methods to extend the definition
already provided to [`makeModel`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeModel).

```typescript
/* Initial model creation without definition */
export default makeModel('posts')
  .extend({
    title: attr<string>(),
    description: attr<string>(),
  })
  .extend({
    publishedAt: attr(toDateTime()),
    get published() {
      return !!this.publishedAt;
    },
  })
  .configure({
    /* ...configuration */
  });
```

This can be useful when sharing common features across models: creation
timestamps, client side ID generation, etc.

If you wish to learn more about the composition capabilities of models, you
should read the
[advanced guide about models composition](/docs/digging-deeper/models/models-composition).

:::info

Each call to `extend` or `configure` will return a child class of the
original model class.

:::

#### Note on exported value

In many Foscia guides and examples, you will see that the ES6 class returned by
[`makeModel`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeModel) is extended before
exporting: we use `export default class Post extends makeModel...` instead of
`export default makeModel...`.

This has two benefits:

- When using TypeScript, it allows to only import the type of the class using
  `import type Post from './models/post'` and avoids circular dependencies when
  models have circular relationships
- It gives you more flexibility as you can quickly add custom properties and
  methods in the future

However, both syntax are valid. Use the one you prefer! ðŸ¦„

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used like any ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```typescript
const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
post.publishedAt = new Date();
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.published); // true
console.log(post.$exists); // false
```

:::info

Please note that most model's interaction (fetching, updating, etc.) are done
through actions, you can
[**read the actions guide**](/docs/core-concepts/actions) to learn more about
those.

:::

### Utilities

Foscia provides multiple utilities functions to interact with models.

  Models' utilities API reference

## Definition

### IDs

#### Description

[`id`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/id) is an ID definition factory used
to define your model's IDs properties.
You can pass a transformer or a default value to this factory.

- Foscia consider your IDs as `string`, `number` or `null` values by default.
  Each model have `id` and `lid` properties representing record identification.
  If you want to change the typing of those properties or transform values, you
  can use the `id` function.
- `id` properties can be transformed.
  [Read more on the transformers guide](/docs/digging-deeper/models/models-transformers).
- `id` definition factory supports [chained modifiers](#ids-chained-modifiers).

:::warning

`id` cannot use another type than `number`, `string` or `null` and can only be
used on `id` and `lid` keyed model's properties. There is currently no way of
aliasing an ID in Foscia.

[**Please fill an issue if this is something you need.**](https://github.com/foscia-dev/foscia/issues/new/choose)

:::

#### Example

```typescript
import { id, toString } from '@foscia/core';

// With TypeScript type.
id<string>();
// With default value.
id(null as string | null);
id(() => null as string | null);
// With transformer to infer type.
id(toString());
// With chained modifiers.
id(toString())
  .nullable()
  .default(() => null)
  .readOnly();
```

#### API {#ids-chained-modifiers}

[`ModelIdFactory`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/ModelIdFactory)
provides type definition of `id` chained modifiers.

### Attributes

#### Description

[`attr`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/attr) is an attribute definition
factory used to define your model's
attributes. You can pass a transformer or a default value to this factory.

- Foscia consider your attributes as non-nullable values by default.
- Non-loaded attributes will have a value of `undefined`.
- `attr` properties can be transformed.
  [Read more on the transformers guide](/docs/digging-deeper/models/models-transformers).
- `attr` definition factory supports
  [chained modifiers](#attributes-chained-modifiers).

#### Example

```typescript
import { attr, toDateTime } from '@foscia/core';

// With TypeScript type.
attr<string>();
// With default value.
attr(null as string | null);
attr(() => null as string | null);
// With transformer to infer type.
attr(toDateTime());
// With chained modifiers.
attr(toDateTime())
  .nullable()
  .default(() => null)
  .readOnly()
  .alias('published-at')
  .sync('pull');
```

#### API {#attributes-chained-modifiers}

[`ModelAttritbueFactory`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/ModelAttritbueFactory)
provides type definition of `attr` chained modifiers.

### Relations

#### Description

[`hasMany`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/hasMany) and
[`hasOne`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/hasOne) are relation
definition factories used to define your model's relations.
As suggested by their names, `hasMany` represents a
relation to a list of models and `hasOne` represents a relation to a single
model. You can pass the relation information to this factory.

- Foscia consider your relations as non-nullable values by default.
- Non-loaded relations will have a value of `undefined`.
- `hasOne` and `hasMany` definition factories supports
  [chained modifiers](#relations-chained-modifiers).
- Depending on your data structure, you should follow one of the recommandation
  over relations definition to avoid circular dependencies errors:
  - [Explicit **model** when **not having circular dependencies**](#explicit-model-when-not-having-circular-references).
  - [Explicit **type** when **having circular dependencies**](#explicit-type-when-having-circular-references).

#### Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem
    value="hasOne"
    label="hasOne"
    default
  >

```typescript
import { hasOne } from '@foscia/core';
import User from './user';

// With explicit related model.
hasOne(() => User);
// With TypeScript type.
hasOne<User>();
// With explicit related type.
hasOne<User>('users');
// With config object.
hasOne<User>({ type: 'users', path: 'author' });
// With chained modifiers.
hasOne<User>('users')
  .config({ path: 'author' })
  .nullable()
  .default(() => null)
  .readOnly()
  .alias('author')
  .sync('pull');
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem
    value="hasMany"
    label="hasMany"
  >

```typescript
import { hasMany } from '@foscia/core';
import Comment from './comment';

// With explicit related model.
hasMany(() => Comment);
// With TypeScript type.
hasMany<Comment[]>();
// With explicit related type.
hasMany<Comment[]>('comments');
// With config object.
hasMany<Comment[]>({ type: 'comments', path: 'comments' });
// With chained modifiers.
hasMany<Comment[]>('comments')
  .config({ path: 'comments' })
  .nullable()
  .default(() => null)
  .readOnly()
  .alias('comments')
  .sync('pull');
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Configuration {#relations-configuration}

Using `config` chained modifier, you can customize the
[`ModelRelationConfig`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/ModelRelationConfig),
which can vary between implementations and used dependencies.

#### API {#relations-chained-modifiers}

[`ModelRelationFactory`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/ModelRelationFactory)
provides type definition of `hasMany` and `hasOne` chained modifiers.

#### Polymorphism

Defining a polymorphic relation is pretty simple:

```typescript
// With explicit related models.
hasOne(() => [Post, Comment]);
hasMany(() => [Post, Comment]);
// With explicit related types.
hasOne<Post | Comment>(['posts', 'comments']);
hasMany<(Post | Comment)[]>(['posts', 'comments']);
```

:::warning

Polymorphism may require a specific configuration of your action or your data
source.

For example, polymorphism is supported out of the box with JSON:API, because
each record have a special `type` property which is resolved by Foscia to the
correct model.

When implementing polymorphism with a REST data source, your record JSON object
must contain a `type` property matching your Foscia models' types.

:::

#### Recommandations

##### Explicit model when not having circular references

If your models does not contain ciruclar references (e.g. Post has a "author"
relation to User and User has a "favoritePosts" relation to Post), you should
define your relations with explicit related model as follow:

```typescript
import { hasOne } from '@foscia/core';
import User from './user';

hasOne(() => User);
```

This will make identifying a relation's related model easier for Foscia and make
registering your models optional.

##### Explicit type when having circular references

If your models does contain ciruclar references (e.g. Post has a "author"
relation to User and User has a "favoritePosts" relation to Post), you should
define your relations with a TypeScript type as follow:

```typescript
import { hasOne } from '@foscia/core';
import type User from './user';

hasOne<User>();
```

Notice the `import type` for type definition when using TypeScript. This will
import the type of the model and will avoid circular dependencies at runtime.

You should also
[correctly register your models](/docs/digging-deeper/actions/models-registration)
on your action factory registry.

When using a data source where each record contains an explicit type info (e.g.
JSON:API), you don't have anything to do.

If your data source does not provide an explicit type info, you should either:

- Let Foscia guess the related type from the relation's name.
- Add an explicit mapped type to the relation as follow:

```typescript
import { hasOne } from '@foscia/core';
import type User from './user';

hasOne<User>('users');
```

### Custom properties

In addition to IDs, attributes and relations, you can implement additional
properties to your model. It's useful when you need computed values (getters) or
specific instance methods.

This can be done using the definition or an extending class:

```typescript
// Directly in the definition.
export default makeModel('users', {
  firstName: attr(toString()),
  lastName: attr(toString()),
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
});

// Inside an extending class.
export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
  firstName: attr(toString()),
  lastName: attr(toString()),
}) {
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

:::warning

Please note that when using the object spread syntax, you won't be able to get a
correctly typed `this` context _inside the current definition object_ (it is
still available in next/previous definition or in class body). This is because
of an
[**issue due to a TypeScript limitation**](https://github.com/foscia-dev/foscia/issues/2).

:::

## Hooks

### Using hooks

You can hook multiple events on model's instances using hook registration
functions, such as [`onCreating`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onCreating).

To hook on an event, use the dedicated hook registration function. Each
hook registration function will return a callback to unregister the hook.

```typescript
import { onCreating } from '@foscia/core';

// After this, the hook will run on each User instance saving.
const unregisterThisHook = onCreating(User, async (user) => {
  // TODO Do something (a)sync with user instance before saving.
});

// After this, this hook will never run again.
unregisterThisHook();
```

You can also use [`unregisterHook`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/unregisterHook)
to remove a registered hook from a model.

```typescript
import { onCreating, unregisterHook } from '@foscia/core';

const myCreatingHook = async (user: User) => {
  // TODO Do something (a)sync with user instance before saving.
};

// After this, the hook will run on each User instance saving.
onCreating(User, myCreatingHook);

// After this, this hook will never run again.
unregisterHook(User, 'creating', myCreatingHook);
```

You can temporally disable hook execution for a given model by using the
[`withoutHooks`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/withoutHooks) function.
[`withoutHooks`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/withoutHooks) can receive
a sync or async callback: if an async callback is passed (e.g. returning a
`Promise`), it will also return a `Promise`.

```typescript
import { withoutHooks } from '@foscia/core';

const asyncResultOfYourCallback = await withoutHooks(User, async () => {
// TODO Do something async and return it.
});
```

:::warning

**Foscia may also register hooks internally** when using some features, such
as relations inverse, etc. Be careful when running a callback
without model's hooks, as those hooks will also be disabled.

:::

### Instances hooks

:::info

Most instances hooks callbacks can be asynchronous and are executed in a
sequential fashion (one by one, not parallelized). Only `init` is a sync
hook callback.

:::

You can hook on multiple events on instances:

- [`onInit`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onInit):
  instance was constructed by calling `new` on model class.
- [`onRetrieved`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onRetrieved):
  instance was deserialized from a backend response.
- [`onCreating`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onCreating):
  action to create instance will run soon.
- [`onCreated`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onCreated):
  action to create instance was ran successfully.
- [`onUpdating`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onUpdating):
  action to update instance will run soon.
- [`onUpdated`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onUpdated):
  action to update instance was ran successfully.
- [`onSaving`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onSaving):
  action to save (create or update) instance will run soon (always
  ran after `onCreating` and `onUpdating`).
- [`onSaved`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onSaved):
  action to save (create or update) instance was ran successfully
  (always ran after `onCreated` and `onUpdated`).
- [`onDestroying`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onDestroying):
  action to destroy instance will run soon.
- [`onDestroyed`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onDestroyed):
  action to destroy instance was ran successfully.

Each of these hooks callback will receive an instance as parameter:

```typescript
import { onCreating } from '@foscia/core';

onCreating(User, async (user) => {
});
```

### Models hooks

:::info

Models hooks callbacks are synchronous and are executed in
a sequential fashion (one by one, not parallelized).

:::

Only `boot` event can be hooked on a model class, using
[`onBoot`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onBoot).
It is like [`onInit`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onInit),
but will be called only once per model and will receive the model class.

```typescript
import { onBoot } from '@foscia/core';

onBoot(User, async (UserModel) => {
});
```

### Properties hooks

:::info

Instances properties hooks callbacks are synchronous and are executed in
a sequential fashion (one by one, not parallelized).

:::

You can hook on multiple events on instances' properties:

- [`onPropertyReading`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onPropertyReading):
  an instance property getter is called (ran before getting value).
- [`onPropertyRead`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onPropertyRead):
  an instance property getter is called (ran after getting value).
- [`onPropertyWriting`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onPropertyWriting):
  an instance property setter is called (ran before setting value).
- [`onPropertyWrite`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/onPropertyWrite):
  an instance property setter is called (ran after setting value).

Reading hooks will receive the instance and property key, current value and definition:

```typescript
import { onPropertyReading, onPropertyRead } from '@foscia/core';

// Hook on specific property reading.
onPropertyReading(User, 'email', ({ instance, key, value, def }) => {
});
onPropertyRead(User, 'email', ({ instance, key, value, def }) => {
});

// Hook on any property reading.
onPropertyReading(User, ({ instance, key, value, def }) => {
});
onPropertyRead(User, ({ instance, key, value, def }) => {
});
```

Writing hooks will receive the instance and property key, previous value, next value and definition:

```typescript
import { onPropertyWriting, onPropertyWrite } from '@foscia/core';

// Hook on specific property reading.
onPropertyWriting(User, 'email', ({ instance, key, prev, next, def }) => {
});
onPropertyWrite(User, 'email', ({ instance, key, prev, next, def }) => {
});

// Hook on any property reading.
onPropertyWriting(User, ({ instance, key, prev, next, def }) => {
});
onPropertyWrite(User, ({ instance, key, prev, next, def }) => {
});
```

To unregister a property hook callback using
[`unregisterHook`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/unregisterHook),
you should pass the event name with or without the property's key,
depending on if it is a specific property hook callback or not:

```typescript
import { unregisterHook } from '@foscia/core';

// Unregister specific property hook.
unregisterHook(User, 'property:reading:email', registeredCallback);
unregisterHook(User, 'property:read:email', registeredCallback);
unregisterHook(User, 'property:writing:email', registeredCallback);
unregisterHook(User, 'property:write:email', registeredCallback);

// Unregister non-specific properties hook.
unregisterHook(User, 'property:reading', registeredCallback);
unregisterHook(User, 'property:read', registeredCallback);
unregisterHook(User, 'property:writing', registeredCallback);
unregisterHook(User, 'property:write', registeredCallback);
```

### Using hooks with composition

All models, instances and properties hooks can be used on
[composables](/docs/digging-deeper/models/models-composition#composable-using-hooks)
and [models factories](/docs/digging-deeper/models/models-composition#factory-using-hooks).

## Special properties

Foscia models provide special properties on both the model class and its
instances, which you can discover inside the API reference:

- [`Model`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/Model)
- [`ModelInstance`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/ModelInstance)
