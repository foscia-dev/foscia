# Support policy

:::info

Currently, only the latest major version of Foscia is actively maintained.

:::

**All major release of Foscia may contain breaking changes!**

In addition, some APIs may be documented with the following tags:

- `@internal` describes an internal API you should not be using.
- `@experimental` describes a public API you can use but which may not follow
  semantic versioning rules.

You should check the [**migration guides**](/docs/upgrade/migration) when
updating Foscia packages to a new major release and update relevant parts
of your code according to those guides.

:::info

Until Foscia `v1.0.0` is released, each minor release (e.g. `v0.1.x` to
`v0.2.x`) will contain breaking changes, and is considered a major release
regarding our support policy.
