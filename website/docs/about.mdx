## What is Foscia?

_Type safe, modular and intuitive API/data client for JS/TS._

**Foscia acts as an intermediary layer** between your application and
your data source (API, database). It helps **keeping your data structure clear
and type safe** with simple models definition and provide a lot of
useful tools to make common tasks easier (changes tracking, hooks,
serialization, etc.), allowing you to focus on your features!
It is built with **functional programming** in mind, has a clear and complete
API and is **fully tree-shakable**.
It is **framework-agnostic** and can integrate inside
any app using JavaScript or TypeScript, and with any data source,
with already implemented HTTP/REST/JSON:API exchanges.


- Exchange with any REST or JSON:API backend with already implemented adapters.
- Modular with simple configuration and framework-agnostic.
- Fully tree-shakable for optimal build size.
- Strong type your data structure with TS.
- Record changes on data during lifecycle with instance's snapshots.
- Register hooks, such as saving or deleting.
- Never re-fetch data thanks to the cache system.
- Get started quickly with the built-in CLI.
- Free and open-source under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## How does it integrate in your app?

<SchemaSvg />

Foscia acts as an intermediary layer between your application and
your data source (API, database).

You define your data structure using models (attributes, relations),
customize your data interactions using actions (serialization, etc.)
and can directly get a smooth and clear exchange with your data source.

## Starting point

You may start to discover Foscia from different point of view.

- [Install](/docs/installation) the package to use it immediately
- [Get started](/docs/getting-started) using our simple guide about interacting
  with a JSON:API or REST API
- [Live test through the Playground](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/boring-hoover-9n3ylg?file=%2Fsrc%2Fplayground.ts%3A11%2C42)
  using a fake JSON REST API
- [Check out examples](/docs/category/examples) built with Foscia to know if the
  API fits your needs
