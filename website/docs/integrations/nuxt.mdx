:::tip What you'll learn

- Preparing and configuring Foscia for server-side rendering (SSR)

:::

## Server-side rendering

Foscia can easily integrate within a Nuxt project, but will require additional
configuration to support server-side rendering (SSR) for two reasons:

- Foscia HTTP actions are based on
  [browser `fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
  and don't automatically switch between `fetch` implementations for Node or
  browser.
- Nuxt passes payloads from server to client, such as state from
  [`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#useasyncdata)
  or [`useState`](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/state-management), and
  Foscia instances are not serializable without a
  [payload plugin](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-nuxt-app#payload).

### Setup

#### `fetch` implementation in action factory

First, you will need a `fetch` implementation which works in both Node
and browser environments.

Nuxt comes with [`ofetch`](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) library for this
purpose, which you can install if it is not already a dependency of your
project.

<ShellCommand command="add ofetch" />

Once `ofetch` is installed, you can configure it on your action factory
adapter. Here is an exemple with `makeJsonRestAdapter`, but the configuration
is the same with other HTTP based adapters.

```typescript
import { makeActionFactory } from '@foscia/core';
import { makeJsonRestAdapter } from '@foscia/rest';
// highlight.addition
import { ofetch } from 'ofetch';

export default makeActionFactory({
  // ...
  ...makeJsonRestAdapter({
// highlight.addition
    fetch: ofetch.native,
  }),
});
```

:::warning

Don't forget the `.native` property when binding the `fetch` implementation
inside the configuration object, because Foscia requires the native `fetch` API.

:::

#### Publishing payload plugin

Finally, you will need to define a custom payload plugin, which will reduce and
revive Foscia models' instances when passing payloads from server to client.
To quickly set up this, Foscia CLI provides `foscia nuxt:payload-plugin` command which
will create reducer and reviver (if they are missing) and will publish a
`fosciaPayloadPlugin.ts` file into
[`plugins` directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins).

<ShellCommand command="foscia integrate nuxt payload-plugin" />

:::warning

Be aware that this plugin must be registered before any payload reduce/revive
tasks. If you need to priorise it, check out the
[**registration order guide on Nuxt docs**](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins#registration-order).

:::

### Usage

You can now use Foscia in any server/client context using `useAsyncData`.

```html title="pages/products.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { all, query } from '@foscia/core';
import action from '../data/action';
import Post from '../data/models/post';

const { data: posts } = useAsyncData(
  'posts',
  () => action().run(query(Post), all()),
);
</script>

<template>
  <div v-for="post in (posts ?? [])" :key="`posts-${post.id}`">
    {{ post.title }}
  </div>
</template>
```
