# Testing

:::tip What you'll learn

- Mocking action factory for unit tests
- Writing expectations about actions
- Conditionally running actions

:::

## Integration tests

Integration tests goal is to ensure separate parts of your software works
together.

When using Foscia, this probably means you want to check that your UI correctly
interact with a backend or database using Foscia.
**Therefore, Foscia does not provide any integration tests utilities, because
those tests should not mock or fake any Foscia behaviors.**

## Unit tests

:::warning

**Unit testing Foscia is currently experimental and may change.**
This gives us the flexibility to improve the API.

:::

Unit tests are focused on checking small and independent parts of your software.

This probably means you want to check functions which are interacting with a
backend or database using Foscia API.

The simplest way to write unit tests of parts of code using Foscia is to mock
your action factory and define expected results and contexts expectation.

Foscia provide a simple set of functions and objects to help you to write unit
tests with any testing framework (Jest, Vitest, etc.).
Because it is framework-agnostic, Foscia does not provide any
expectation functions.

### Preparation

Start by installing Foscia test helpers if not already.

<ShellCommand command="add dev @foscia/test" />

Once test helpers are installed, you should make your action factory "mockable"
using `makeActionFactoryMockable`. This will transform the action factory
function so it can be mocked or unmocked using `mockAction` and `unmockAction`.

```typescript title="action.ts"
import { makeActionFactory } from '@foscia/core';
import { makeActionFactoryMockable } from '@foscia/test';

export default makeActionFactoryMockable(
  makeActionFactory({
    // ...
  }),
);
```

### Mocking action factory

You can mock your action factory using `mockAction` function. It is important to
just pass your action factory `action` and not the call to the factory
`action()`, because the mock will install on the function itself.

When mocking your action, Foscia is replacing the base factory function with a
proxy function which will built a proxy action. Each enhancer will
apply normally and make the context evolve, but will be tracked.
Running the action won't execute any real runner, but will intercept the
context, check conditionals and expectations, and finally returns the mocked
result.

```typescript title="test/actionMock.ts"
import { ActionFactoryMock, mockAction, unmockAction } from '@foscia/test';
import action from './action';

let actionMock: ActionFactoryMock;

beforeEach(() => {
  actionMock = mockAction(action);
});

afterEach(() => {
  unmockAction(action);
});

export default actionMock;
```

### Concret example

Consider the following `registerUser` function we would like to unit test.

```typescript
import { create, fill, oneOrFail } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';
import User from './models/user';

export default function registerUser(
  email: string,
  acceptedTerms: boolean,
): Promise<User> {
  if (!acceptedTerms) {
    throw new Error('User did not accept terms and conditions.');
  }

  const user = fill(new User(), {
    email,
    acceptedTermsAt: new Date(),
  });

  return action(create(user), oneOrFail());
}
```

We can write two tests for this function:

1. One asserting an action run and return a user if he accepted the terms.
2. Another asserting no action run occurred and an error is throw if he refused the terms.

```typescript
describe('registration', () => {
  it('should create user', async () => {
    // Expect one run and return value passed as `create` first argument.
    actionMock.mock(({ calls }) => calls.args('create')[0]).once();

    const user = await registerUser('john.doe@example.com', true);

    expect(user).toBeInstanceOf(User);
    expect(user.email).toStrictEqual('john.doe@example.com');
    expect(user.acceptedTermsAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  });

  it('should fail creating user with non accepted terms', async () => {
    expect(() => registerUser('john.doe@example.com', true))
      .rejects.toThrow('User did not accept terms and conditions');
  });
});
```

### Advanced mock usage

When calling `mock`, you create an action execution mock with
a custom return value, which you can customize using various options.
All options are chainable.

#### Mock return value

When using `mock`, you can specify a value to return on action run. If you
want to compute a value using a callback, just pass a function to it.
For this, your callback will receive an
[`ActionTestContext`](/docs/api/@foscia/test/type-aliases/ActionTestContext) object.

```typescript
// Direct.
actionMock.mock(user);
// Factory.
actionMock.mock(() => new User());
// Factory using test context.
actionMock.mock(({ calls }) => calls.args('create')[0]);
```

#### Mock duration

You can setup a custom limit for your action mocking. This will avoid
mocking the return value of any action indefinitely (which is the default
behavior). It can also be used to prepare mock for consecutive action.

```typescript
// Only mock for a specified number of execution.
actionMock.mock(value).once();
actionMock.mock(value).twice();
actionMock.mock(value).times(3);

// Use it to mock consecutive actions.
actionMock.mock(valueForFirstAction).once();
actionMock.mock(valueForSecondAction).once();
```

#### Conditional mock

You can also use `when` to only mock the action if it matches a given predicate.
For this, your callback will receive an
[`ActionTestContext`](/docs/api/@foscia/test/type-aliases/ActionTestContext) object.

```typescript
// Only mock when having a `create` enhancer with a user instance.
actionMock.mock(value).when(({ calls }) => (
  calls.args('create')[0] instanceof User
));
```

#### Expectations

You can also use `expect` to run expectations using your favorite framework.
Expectations won't run if a predicate is not matching for your mock.
For this, your callback will receive an
[`ActionTestContext`](/docs/api/@foscia/test/type-aliases/ActionTestContext) object.

```typescript
actionMock.mock(value).expect(({ calls }) => {
  expect(calls.args('create')[0]).toBeInstanceOf(User);
  expect(calls.args('create')[0].email).toStrictEqual('john.doe@example.com');
  expect(calls.has('oneOrFail')).toStrictEqual(true);
});
```

#### Combining all options

All mock options can be chained to create more specific mocks.

```typescript
actionMock.mock(value)
  .once()
  .when(() => true)
  .expect(() => {
  });
```
