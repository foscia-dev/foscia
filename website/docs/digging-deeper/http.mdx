# HTTP

:::tip What you'll learn

- Configuring your action factory to only make HTTP request
- Using Foscia as an HTTP client

:::

## Setup

You can use Foscia as a simple HTTP client (just like Axios). For this, you can
configure an HTTP client action factory.

:::info

If you are using JSON REST or JSON:API implementations, you can already use your
action factory as an HTTP client.

:::

### CLI (recommended)

You can get started for Foscia as an HTTP client using the
[`@foscia/cli`](/docs/digging-deeper/cli).

<ShellCommand command="foscia init src/http --usage=http" />

### Manually

```typescript title="action.ts"
import { makeActionFactory } from '@foscia/core';
import { makeHttpAdapter } from '@foscia/http';

export default makeActionFactory({
  ...makeHttpAdapter({
    baseURL: 'https://example.com',
  }),
});
```

## Usage

Once your action factory is ready, sending HTTP request is pretty easy using
provided enhancers ([`makeGet`](/docs/reference/actions-enhancers#makeget),
[`makePost`](/docs/reference/actions-enhancers#makepost), etc.). Running a
request is done by [`raw`](/docs/reference/actions-runners#raw) runner, which
will retrieve a fetch `Response` object. You can also pass a callback to `raw`
to retrieve a value from the `Response` object.

```typescript
import { makeGet, makePost } from '@foscia/http';
import action from './action';

// GET https://example.com/
const response = await action().use(makeGet('/')).run(raw());

// GET https://example.com/api/posts (and get JSON payload)
const data = await action()
  .use(
    makePost('/api/posts', {
      data: { title: 'Hello World!' },
    }),
  )
  .run(raw((response) => response.json()));
```
