# Models relations

:::tip What you'll learn

- Checking if relations are loaded
- Creating functions which will load your relations
- Configuring those functions to match your needs

:::

## Checking loading state

If you want to check if an instance's relations (or deep relations) are loaded,
you can use the [`loaded`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/loaded) function.

[`loaded`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/loaded) recursively inspect
relations. This means it will only return `true` if **all** relations of
the instance (and sub-instances for deep relations) are loaded.

```typescript
import { loaded } from '@foscia/core';

// True if comments is loaded.
loaded(myPost, 'comments');
// True if comments and each author of comments are loaded.
loaded(myPost, 'comments.author');
```

## Loading relations

Since Foscia uses a functional approach for your action, you are able to load a
relation using different ways depending on your data source implementation.

For this, Foscia provides multiple loader factories providing various
behaviors and options.

### Using CLI

You can generate a new loader using [`@foscia/cli`](/docs/digging-deeper/usages/cli).

<ShellCommand command="foscia make loader" />

### 1. Instance refreshing

#### Description

This is the simplest way of loading relations if your data source implementation
provides an inclusion of relations and a way to filter models based on IDs (e.g.
JSON:API). It uses
[`makeRefreshIncludeLoader`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeRefreshIncludeLoader).

This loader will target the model index and include the requested relations. It
supports nested relations keys if your data source supports them.

:::info

This loader is recommended as it will only run one action for many models and
relations. But, be aware that you should implement an adapted `prepare` to
filter the fetched models (this will avoid overloading your data source with
useless records fetching).

It should support polymorphism if your data provider does.

:::

#### Example

Here is an example when using a JSON:API backend with an `ids` filter available.

```typescript title="loaders/loadWithRefresh.ts"
import { makeRefreshIncludeLoader } from '@foscia/core';
import { filterBy } from '@foscia/jsonapi';
import action from './action';

export default makeRefreshIncludeLoader(action, {
  prepare: (action, { instances }) => action.use(filterBy({ ids: instances.map((i) => i.id) })),
});
```

You can now use the loader on any instance.

```typescript
import loadWithRefresh from './loaders/loadWithRefresh';

await loadWithRefresh(myPost, 'comments');
await loadWithRefresh(myPostsArray, ['comments', 'comments.author']);
```

#### Configuration

All available configuration options are described in the
[`RefreshIncludeLoaderOptions` API reference](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/RefreshIncludeLoaderOptions).

### 2. Related model action

<FunctionInfo version="0.8.2" />

#### Description

This method is best suited for multiple instance relation loading with
implementations providing IDs instead of included relations, such as some REST
implementations. It uses
[`makeQueryModelLoader`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeQueryModelLoader).
If nested relations are passed (such as `comments.author`),
it will [`include`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/include) the nested
relations during the root model action.

:::info

This loader is recommended as it will only run one action per direct relation.
It supports polymorphic relations when
[**related models are correctly defined on relations**](/docs/core-concepts/models#recommandations)
and `extract` option correctly retrieve IDs.

:::

#### Example

```typescript title="loaders/loadWithModelQuery.ts"
import { makeQueryModelLoader } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';

export default makeQueryModelLoader(action, {
  prepare: (action, { ids }) => action.use(param('ids', ids)),
});
```

You can now use the loader on any instance.

```typescript
import loadWithModelQuery from './loaders/loadWithModelQuery';

await loadWithModelQuery(myPost, 'comments');
await loadWithModelQuery(myPostsArray, ['comments', 'comments.author']);
```

#### Configuration

##### `extract: (instance: ModelInstance, relation: ModelRelationKey): Arrayable<ModelIdType> | null | undefined`

A function to extract the related IDs and types from an instance.
Default behavior is to use the raw record value for relation's key and and build
one or many objects containing type and ID.

<details>

<summary>

Extract function example and side notes

</summary>

Here is the default implementation for `extract` function using
[**`makeQueryModelLoaderExtractor`**](https://github.com/foscia-dev/foscia/blob/main/packages/core/src/model/relations/makeQueryModelLoaderExtractor.ts)
helper, as an example of implementation.

```typescript
import { makeQueryModelLoaderExtractor, normalizeKey } from '@foscia/core';

const extract = makeQueryModelLoaderExtractor(
  (instance, relation) => instance.$raw[normalizeKey(instance.$model, relation)],
  (value) => (typeof value === 'object' ? { id: value.id, type: value.type } : { id: value }),
);
```

It will support extracting both raw JSON data related IDs extraction
(basic and polymorphic relations):

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Foo",
  "comments": ["1", "2"]
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "posts",
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Foo",
  "relatedContents": [
    {
      "type": "posts",
      "id": "2"
    },
    {
      "type": "galleries",
      "id": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::info

Notice that Foscia will try to deserialize each relations were record is an
object or array of objects value (such as in the 2nd example). This will mark
the relation as loaded even if the related value attributes are not loaded.
To avoid this, you can disable the relation's syncing on pull
(e.g. `hasOne().sync('push')`), as it will disable relation deserialization.

:::

</details>

##### `prepare: (action: Action, context: { ids: ModelIdType[]; relations: string[] }): Awaitable<void>`

A function to execute before running action allowing you to prepare the fetch
action (e.g. to avoid fetching a full list of models by filtering on related
IDs).

##### `chunk: (ids: ModelIdType[]): ModelIdType[][]`

A function to split the related IDs array to multiple arrays (e.g. to avoid
hitting pagination limit).

<details>

<summary>

Array chunk function example

</summary>

```typescript
function chunk<T>(items: T[], size: number) {
  const chunks = [] as T[][];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += size) {
    chunks.push(array.slice(i, i + chunkSize));
  }

  return chunks;
}
```

</details>

##### `exclude: (instance: ModelInstance, relations: ModelRelationDotKey): bool`

A function to exclude some relation fetching (e.g. to avoid fetching already
loaded relations).

### 3. Relation action

#### Description

This method is best suited for one instance relation loading with
implementations providing relation reading through a dedicated endpoint/query,
such as JSON:API. It uses
[`makeQueryRelationLoader`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeQueryRelationLoader).
If nested relations are passed (such as `comments.author`),
it will [`include`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/include) the nested
relations during the root model action.

:::warning

Because this loader will run one action per instance and relation, it is only
recommended for one instance's relation loading, not many.

It should support polymorphism if your data provider does.

:::

#### Example

```typescript title="loaders/loadWithRelationQuery.ts"
import { makeQueryRelationLoader } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';

export default makeQueryRelationLoader(action);
```

You can now use the loader on any instance.

```typescript
import loadWithRelationQuery from './loaders/loadWithRelationQuery';

await loadWithRelationQuery(myPost, 'comments');
```

#### Configuration

##### `exclude: (instance: ModelInstance, relations: ModelRelationDotKey): bool`

A function to exclude some relation fetching (e.g. to avoid fetching already
loaded relations).

##### `disablePerformanceWarning: boolean`

`makeQueryRelationLoader` will log a warning if you are using it to
load multiple instances relations in one call, because it may cause
performance issues (multiple actions would run).

You can pass this option with `true` to avoid this warning.

## Loading missing relations only

Every loader factory provides an `exclude` option which can remove some
instances or relations before running actions.

This is useful to avoid loading already loaded relations, and can be done
easily using the [`loaded`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/loaded) function.

```typescript title="loaders/loadMissingWithRefresh.ts"
import { makeRefreshIncludeLoader, loaded } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';

export default makeRefreshIncludeLoader(action, {
  exclude: loaded,
  // other options
});
```
