# Models relations

:::tip What you'll learn

- Checking if relations are loaded
- Creating functions which will load your relations
- Configuring those functions to match your needs

:::

## Checking loading state

If you want to check if an instance's relations (or deep relations) are loaded,
you can use the `loaded` function.

`loaded` recursively inspect relations. This means it will only return `true` if
**all** relations of the instance (and sub-instances for deep relations) are
loaded.

```typescript
import { loaded } from '@foscia/core';

// True if comments is loaded.
loaded(myPost, 'comments');
// True if comments and each author of comments are loaded.
loaded(myPost, 'comments.author');
```

## Loading relations

Since Foscia uses a functional approach for your action, you are able to load a
relation using different ways depending on your data source implementation.

For this, Foscia provides multiple loader factories providing various
behaviors and options.

### 1. Instance refreshing

This is the simplest way of loading relations if your data source implementation
provides an inclusion of relations and a way to filter models based on IDs (e.g.
JSON:API).

This loader will target the model index and include the requested relations. It
supports nested relations keys if your data source supports them.

Here is an example when using a JSON:API backend with an `ids` filter available.

```typescript title="loaders/loadWithRefresh.ts"
import { makeRefreshIncludeLoader } from '@foscia/core';
import { filterBy } from '@foscia/jsonapi';
import action from './action';

export default makeRefreshIncludeLoader(action, {
  prepare: (action, { instances }) => action.use(filterBy({ ids: instances.map((i) => i.id) })),
});
```

You can now use the loader on any instance.

```typescript
import loadWithRefresh from './loaders/loadWithRefresh';

await loadWithRefresh(myPost, 'comments');
await loadWithRefresh(myPostsArray, ['comments', 'comments.author']);
```

:::info

This loader is recommended as it will only run one action for many models and
relations. But, be aware that you should implement an adapted `prepare` to
filter the fetched models (this will avoid overloading your data source with
useless records fetching).

:::

#### Options

##### `prepare: (action: Action, context: { instances: ModelInstance[]; relations: string[] }): Awaitable<void>`

A function to execute before running action allowing you to prepare the refresh
action (e.g. to avoid fetching a full list of models by filtering on instances'
IDs).

##### `chunk: (instances: ModelInstance[]): ModelInstance[][]`

A function to split the instances array to multiple arrays (e.g. to avoid
hitting pagination limit).

##### `exclude: (instance: ModelInstance, relations: ModelRelationDotKey): bool`

A function to exclude some relation fetching (e.g. to avoid fetching already
loaded relations). Notice the following:

- If an instance is excluded for all relations, it will not be refreshed
- If a relation is excluded for all instances, it will not be included during
  refresh

### 2. Related model action

<FunctionInfo version="0.8.2" />

This method is best suited for multiple instance relation loading with
implementations providing IDs instead of included relations, such as some REST
implementations. If nested relations are passed (such as `comments.author`),
it will `include` the nested relations during the root model action.

```typescript title="loaders/loadWithModelQuery.ts"
import { makeQueryModelLoader } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';

export default makeQueryModelLoader(action, {
  prepare: (action, { ids }) => action.use(param('ids', ids)),
});
```

You can now use the loader on any instance.

```typescript
import loadWithModelQuery from './loaders/loadWithModelQuery';

await loadWithModelQuery(myPost, 'comments');
await loadWithModelQuery(myPostsArray, ['comments', 'comments.author']);
```

:::info

This loader is recommended as it will only run one action per direct relation.

:::

#### Options

##### `extract: (instance: ModelInstance, relation: ModelRelationKey): Arrayable<ModelIdType> | null | undefined`

A function to extract the related IDs from an instance. Default behavior
is to use the raw record fetched from data source's value for relation's key
(e.g. retrieving `instance.$raw[relation]` value).

##### `prepare: (action: Action, context: { ids: ModelIdType[]; relations: string[] }): Awaitable<void>`

A function to execute before running action allowing you to prepare the fetch
action (e.g. to avoid fetching a full list of models by filtering on related
IDs).

##### `chunk: (ids: ModelIdType[]): ModelIdType[][]`

A function to split the related IDs array to multiple arrays (e.g. to avoid
hitting pagination limit).

##### `exclude: (instance: ModelInstance, relations: ModelRelationDotKey): bool`

A function to exclude some relation fetching (e.g. to avoid fetching already
loaded relations).

### 3. Relation action

This method is best suited for one instance relation loading with
implementations providing relation reading through a dedicated endpoint/query,
such as JSON:API. If nested relations are passed (such as `comments.author`),
it will `include` the nested relations during the root relation action.

```typescript title="loaders/loadWithRelationQuery.ts"
import { makeQueryRelationLoader } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';

export default makeQueryRelationLoader(action);
```

You can now use the loader on any instance.

```typescript
import loadWithRelationQuery from './loaders/loadWithRelationQuery';

await loadWithRelationQuery(myPost, 'comments');
```

:::warning

Because this loader will run one action per instance and relation, it is only
recommended for one instance's relation loading, not many.

:::

#### Options

##### `exclude: (instance: ModelInstance, relations: ModelRelationDotKey): bool`

A function to exclude some relation fetching (e.g. to avoid fetching already
loaded relations).

##### `disablePerformanceWarning: boolean`

`makeQueryRelationLoader` will log a warning if you are using it to
load multiple instances relations in one call, because it may cause
performance issues (multiple actions would run).

You can pass this option with `true` to avoid this warning.

## Loading missing relations only

Every loader factory provides an `exclude` option which can remove some
instances or relations before running actions.

This is useful to avoid loading already loaded relations, and can be done
easily using the `loaded` function.

```typescript title="loaders/loadMissingWithRefresh.ts"
import { makeRefreshIncludeLoader, loaded } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';

export default makeRefreshIncludeLoader(action, {
  exclude: loaded,
  // other options
});
```
