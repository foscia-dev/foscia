# Creating an action enhancer

:::tip What you'll learn

- Defining a custom action enhancer
- Providing an extension property to your enhancer

:::

Foscia tries to be agnostic of your data source, so sometimes you may require a
custom enhancer to avoid code duplication.

This is a simple guide on defining a custom enhancer, but you may also inspire
from any existing Foscia enhancers.

## Goal

Since Foscia is pagination agnostic, providing a `first` enhancer is not
possible. Here is what we want our new `first` enhancer to do:

- Select the model just like the `find` enhancer, but not a record ID
- Limit the pagination to the first page and one record only

In this example, we will admit a JSON:API is used with the following query
parameters working:

- `page[number]` describes the number of the page to fetch
- `page[size]` describes the count of records to fetch (aka. limit)

:::tip

If you want to create an enhancer which does not use or expand the action's
context typing (such as defining a query parameter, etc.), you can
ignore generic typing.

:::

:::info

This guide is an enhancer version of the `first` runner described in the
[**custom runners guide**](/docs/digging-deeper/actions/custom-action-runners).

:::

## Defining the function

Our implementation of `first` will target the model and paginate the context.

```typescript title="action/enhancers/first.ts"
import { Action, Model, forModel } from '@foscia/core';
import { paginate } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

export default function first<
  C extends {},
  M extends Model,
>(model: M) {
  return (action: Action<C>) =>
    action.use(forModel(model)).use(paginate({ number: 1, size: 1 }));
}
```

:::warning

Please note that when defining custom enhancers or runners, you should always
correctly define generic types. This is very important as it will allow the
context propagation through other enhancers and runners.

:::

## Using the function

Once your enhancer is ready, you may use it like any other Foscia enhancer.

```typescript
import { one } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';
import first from './action/enhancers/first';
import Post from './models/post';

const post = await action().use(first(Post)).run(one());
```

## Defining the extension

Our current enhancer can only be used through an import and the `use` method of
our action. To make it available for the
[builder pattern style calls](/docs/core-concepts/actions#extensions), we must
define an extension for it.

There is currently a limitation of the TypeScript language (Higher Order types
are not available for now) which forces us to declare each extension manually.
The goal of an extension definition is to get a type safe feature directly
available on our action (and so provide autocomplete, context propagation,
etc.).

Once your enhancer extension is ready, you will be able to use it
[as any other enhancers of Foscia](/docs/core-concepts/actions#extensions).

```typescript title="action/enhancers/first.ts"
import {
  Action,
  ActionParsedExtension,
  ConsumeModel,
  forModel,
  makeEnhancersExtension,
  Model,
} from '@foscia/core';
import { paginate } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

// Our previous enhancer code.

export default function first<
  C extends {},
  M extends Model,
>(model: M) {
  return (action: Action<C>) =>
    action.use(forModel(model)).use(paginate({ number: 1, size: 1 }));
}

// The extension typing.
type FirstEnhancerExtension = ActionParsedExtension<{
  first<C extends {}, E extends {}, M extends Model>(
    this: Action<C, E>,
    model: M,
  ): Action<C & ConsumeModel<M>, E>;
}>;

// The extension value.
first.extension = makeEnhancersExtension({ first }) as FirstEnhancerExtension;
```

:::warning

Here again, correctly typing our enhancer extension is really important to get
context and action's extension propagation.

## Transforming it to a runner

Wish `first` was not selecting a model but directly running the action and
fetching a result?

Check out
[the custom runner guide](/docs/digging-deeper/actions/custom-action-runners)
which describe how to code a `first` action runner.
