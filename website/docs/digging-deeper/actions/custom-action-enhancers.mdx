# Creating an action enhancer

:::tip What you'll learn

- Defining a custom action enhancer

:::

Foscia tries to be agnostic of your data source, so sometimes you may require a
custom enhancer to avoid code duplication.

This is a simple guide on defining a custom enhancer, but you may also inspire
from any existing Foscia enhancers.

## Goal

We aim to create a `searchBy` enhancer which will add 2
query parameters using JSON:API enhancers: a search filter and
a sort by search score.

In this example, we will admit a JSON:API is used with the following query
parameters working:

- `filterBy[search]` filters records by a search string
- `sort=searchScore` sorts searched records by their match score

:::warning

Generics inside enhancers and runners provide context typing propagation
and are required when using TypeScript, otherwise, you may experiment
type inference issues (for returned result) and type error when using
other enhancers and runners.

:::

## Using CLI

<ShellCommand command="foscia make enhancer searchBy" />

## Defining the function

Our implementation of `searchBy` will search and sort.

```typescript title="action/enhancers/searchBy.ts"
import { Action, makeEnhancer } from '@foscia/core';
import { filterBy, sortByDesc } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

export default makeEnhancer('searchBy', <C extends {}>(
  search: string,
) => async (action: Action<C>) => action.use(
  filterBy({ search }),
  sortByDesc('searchScore'),
));
```

## Using the function

Once your enhancer is ready, you may use it like any other Foscia enhancer.

```typescript
import { query, all } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';
import searchBy from './enhancers/searchBy';
import Post from './models/post';

const posts = await action().run(
  query(Post),
  searchBy('hello'),
  all(),
);
```
