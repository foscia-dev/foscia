# Creating an action runner

:::tip What you'll learn

- Defining a custom action runner
- Providing an extension property to your runner

:::

Foscia tries to be agnostic of your data source, so sometimes you may require a
custom runner to avoid code duplication.

This is a simple guide on defining a custom runner, but you may also inspire
from any existing Foscia runners.

## Goal

Since Foscia is pagination agnostic, providing a `first` runner is not possible.
Here is what we want our new `first` runner to do:

- Limit the pagination to the first page and one record only
- Fetch the first record using the `one` runner

In this example, we will admit a JSON:API is used with the following query
parameters working:

- `page[number]` describes the number of the page to fetch
- `page[size]` describes the count of records to fetch (aka. limit)

:::tip

If you want to create a runner which does not use the action's
context typing (such as defining a query parameter, etc.), you can
ignore generic typing.

:::

:::info

This guide is a runner version of the `first` enhancer described in the
[**custom enhancers guide**](/docs/digging-deeper/actions/custom-action-enhancers).

:::

## Using CLI

<ShellCommand command="foscia make runner first" />

## Defining the function

Our implementation of `first` will paginate the context and fetch one instance.

```typescript title="action/runners/first.ts"
import {
  Action,
  ConsumeAdapter,
  ConsumeDeserializer,
  one,
} from '@foscia/core';
import { paginate } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

export default function first<
  C extends {},
  RawData,
  Data,
  Deserialized,
>() {
  return (
    action: Action<
      C &
        ConsumeAdapter<RawData, Data> &
        ConsumeDeserializer<Data, Deserialized>
    >,
  ) => action.use(paginate({ number: 1, size: 1 })).run(one());
}
```

:::warning

Please note that when defining custom enhancers or runners, you should always
correctly define generic types. This is very important as it will allow the
context propagation through other enhancers and runners.

:::

## Using the function

Once your runner is ready, you may use it like any other Foscia runner.

```typescript
import { query } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';
import first from './action/runners/first';
import Post from './models/post';

const post = await action().use(query(Post)).run(first());
```

## Defining the extension

Our current runner can only be used through an import and the `use` method of
our action. To make it available for the
[builder pattern style calls](/docs/core-concepts/actions#extensions), we must
define an extension for it.

There is currently a limitation of the TypeScript language (Higher Order types
are not available for now) which forces us to declare each extension manually.
The goal of an extension definition is to get a type safe feature directly
available on our action (and so provide autocomplete, context propagation,
etc.).

Once your runner extension is ready, you will be able to use it
[as any other runners of Foscia](/docs/core-concepts/actions#extensions).

```typescript title="action/runners/first.ts"
import {
  Action,
  ConsumeAdapter,
  ConsumeDeserializer,
  InferConsumedInstance,
  WithParsedExtension,
  appendExtension,
  one,
} from '@foscia/core';
import { paginate } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

// Our previous enhancer code.
function first<
  C extends {},
  RawData,
  Data,
  Deserialized,
>() {
  return (
    action: Action<
      C &
        ConsumeAdapter<RawData, Data> &
        ConsumeDeserializer<Data, Deserialized>
    >,
  ) => action.use(paginate({ number: 1, size: 1 })).run(one());
}

export default /* @__PURE__ */ appendExtension(
  'first',
  first,
  'run',
) as WithParsedExtension<typeof first, {
  // The extension typing.
  first<
    C extends {},
    I extends InferConsumedInstance<C>,
    RawData,
    Data,
    Deserialized,
  >(
    this: Action<
      C &
        ConsumeAdapter<RawData, Data> &
        ConsumeDeserializer<Data, Deserialized>
    >,
  ): Promise<I | null>;
}>;
```

:::warning

Here again, correctly typing our runner extension is really important to get
context and action's extension propagation.
