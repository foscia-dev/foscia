# Creating an action runner

:::tip What you'll learn

- Defining a custom action runner

:::

Foscia tries to be agnostic of your data source, so sometimes you may require a
custom runner to avoid code duplication.

This is a simple guide on defining a custom runner, but you may also inspire
from any existing Foscia runners.

## Goal

Since Foscia is pagination agnostic, providing a `first` runner is not possible.
Here is what we want our new `first` runner to do:

- Limit the pagination to the first page and one record only
- Fetch the first record using the `one` runner

In this example, we will admit a JSON:API is used with the following query
parameters working:

- `page[number]` describes the number of the page to fetch
- `page[size]` describes the count of records to fetch (aka. limit)

:::warning

Generics inside enhancers and runners provide context typing propagation
and are required when using TypeScript, otherwise, you may experiment
type inference issues (for returned result) and type error when using
other enhancers and runners.

:::

## Using CLI

<ShellCommand command="foscia make runner first" />

## Defining the function

Our implementation of `first` will paginate the context and fetch one instance.
Typing is complex here because we are using `one` runner, which requires to provide
a context containing an adapter and a deserializer.

```typescript title="action/runners/first.ts"
import { Action, ConsumeAdapter, ConsumeDeserializer, makeRunner, one } from '@foscia/core';
import { paginate } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

export default makeRunner('first', <C extends {}, RawData, Data, Deserialized>() => async (
  action: Action<C & ConsumeAdapter<RawData, Data> & ConsumeDeserializer<Data, Deserialized>>,
) => action.run(paginate({ number: 1, size: 1 }), one()));
```

## Using the function

Once your runner is ready, you may use it like any other Foscia runner.

```typescript
import { query } from '@foscia/core';
import action from './action';
import first from './runners/first';
import Post from './models/post';

const post = await action(query(Post), first());
```
