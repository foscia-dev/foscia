# Registering models

:::tip What you'll learn

- Cases where you should add a models registry
- Adding a registry to your action factory
- Registering models

:::

## When should you use a registry?

A [`RegistryI`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/type-aliases/RegistryI) is a simple
object which will store your models classes and let Foscia resolves models
from their `type` string.

As stated in the
[models guide](/docs/core-concepts/models#explicit-type-when-having-circular-references),
you may need this object when your models contains circular references, because
you won't be able to import models when strictly following some code style (e.g.
ESLint AirBnB disallow dependency cycle).

## Adding registry

### Defining models list

First, you will need to define a models list which default export an array of
all your available models.

#### Using CLI (recommended)

<ShellCommand command="foscia make models" />

If you choose the "Manually" option, you can rerun this command to update
your models list file.

You can also pass the `--models` option when calling
[`foscia make model <name>`](/docs/digging-deeper/usages/cli#make-model-name) to
automatically update the file after creating the model file.

#### Manually

```typescript title="models.ts"
import Post from './post';
import User from './user';

export default [
  Post,
  User,
];
```

### Adding registry to action factory

Foscia provides a simple implementation for the registry through
[`makeRegistry`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/makeRegistry).

```typescript title="action.ts"
import { makeActionFactory, makeRegistry } from '@foscia/core';
import models from './models';

export default makeActionFactory({
  // Add the registry to your action factory.
  ...makeRegistry(models),
  // ...
});
```

## Listing models

Here are some suggestion on how you can list your models classes easily
without [generating a file using the CLI](#using-cli-recommended).

### Using an `array`

This is the most simple and common way of listing the models classes.

```typescript title="models.ts"
import Post from './post';
import User from './user';

export default [Post, User];
```

### Using `import.meta.global`

This method can be used with some bundlers, such as ViteJS, and will provide you
an automatic registration if your models are in the same directory.

For this, we will assume all models classes are located in a `models` directory.

```typescript title="models.ts"
import { Model } from '@foscia/core';

export default Object.values(import.meta.glob('./models/*.ts', {
  import: 'default,
  eager: true,
}) as { [k: string]: Model });
```

### Using `require.context`

This method can be used with some bundlers, such as Webpack, and will provide
you an automatic registration if your models are in the same directory.

For this, we will assume all models classes are located in a `models` directory.

```typescript title="models.ts"
import { Model } from '@foscia/core';

export default ((context: any) => context.keys().map(
  (key: any) => context(key).default as Model,
))(require.context('./models', true, /\.ts/));
```
