## Usage

### Registering middlewares

You can use middlewares on your actions. Those are working the same as in most
web frameworks, and offer an additional way of interacting with actions and
their results.

To register middlewares, you can use:

- [`appendActionMiddlewares`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/appendActionMiddlewares)
to add new middlewares after already registered ones
- [`prependActionMiddlewares`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/prependActionMiddlewares)
to add new middlewares before already registered ones

Each middleware callback will receive two arguments:
the `action` instance and a `next` callback which continues the action's
execution stack.

Thanks to the access to `next` callback, you can create a middleware which would
execute **before** the action is ran, but also **after**.

```typescript
import { appendActionMiddlewares } from '@foscia/core';

action().use(appendActionMiddlewares([
  (a, next) => {
    // Do something before execution.
    return next(a);
  },
  async (a, next) => {
    const result = await next(a);
    // Do something after execution.
    return result;
  },
]));
```

### Replacing middlewares

Finally, when using [`replaceActionMiddlewares`](/docs/api/@foscia/core/functions/replaceActionMiddlewares),
you can replace the already configured middlewares by passing a factory function.
This allows to replace or merge middlewares manually.

```typescript
import { replaceActionMiddlewares } from '@foscia/core';

action().use(replaceActionMiddlewares((previousActionMiddlewares) => [
  (a, next) => next(a),
  ...previousActionMiddlewares,
]));
```
